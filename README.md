# c-hashtable
A simple hash table implementation in C

This was made for educational purposes as a learning experience.
The hash function could easily (and will) be improved, it currently uses K&R's (bad) hashing algorithm.
It features automatic dynamic sizing and each hash table can have their own specified type of STRING, INTEGER, etc.
